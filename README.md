# random-vpn-connector
A ruby openvpn connection randomizer

You'll need to install 'openvpn' by running:
'apt-get install openvpn'

Make sure you add your openvpn configs and put them in the /certs directory in the repository root.

If you're using configs from Astril, you can download these from your account by going to:
VPN Services -> open vpn certificates -> create and download a new certificates package.

From there you can unzip them into your /certs directory
